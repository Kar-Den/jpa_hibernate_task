Create console application with JPA or Hibernate
* for demonstration implementation use Unit tests or Main method

List of models:

-->4.	Relationship between Employee and EmployeePersonalInfo should be one-to-one (bidirectional)
5.	Relationship between Employee and Project should be many-to-many

2.	Find employee / Unit / Project by id
3.	Delete employee / Unit / Project by id
4.	Update Employee / Unit / Project by id

5.	Add Employee to Unit by id’s
6.	Assign Employee for Project by id’s
